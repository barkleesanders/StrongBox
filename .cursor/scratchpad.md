# Background and Motivation
The StrongBox codebase is undergoing a comprehensive refactor to make it production-ready. The refactor includes code formatting, modularity improvements, enhanced error handling, centralized configuration, security improvements, expanded testing, and updated documentation. The goal is to ensure the codebase is robust, maintainable, and ready for deployment.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring all refactored files are updated correctly in the repository.
- Addressing existing lint and syntax errors, especially those related to indentation and code structure.
- Maintaining a clean git history and logical commit structure.
- Verifying that all tests pass and the application functions as expected after refactor.
- Communicating progress and blockers between Planner and Executor roles.

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. Review and fix all lint and syntax errors in the updated files.
2. Stage, commit, and push all refactored changes to the `refactor/production-ready` branch.
3. Run all tests (locally and/or via CI) to verify code integrity.
4. Review the branch for completeness and correctness.
5. Merge the branch into `main` after verification.
6. Clean up any temporary files or branches.

# Project Status Board
- [ ] Review and fix lint/syntax errors in updated files
- [ ] Stage, commit, and push refactored changes
- [ ] Run and verify all tests
- [ ] Review for completeness/correctness
- [ ] Merge into main
- [ ] Clean up temporary files/branches

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Lint and syntax errors remain in several files (GUI.py, MainApp.py, Database.py, Debug.py, etc.) and need to be addressed before proceeding to commit and push.

# Lessons
- Refactor changes should always be accompanied by lint/syntax checks before staging and committing.
- Large-scale edits may introduce indentation and syntax errors, especially when docstrings or comments are added without reviewing the surrounding code structure.
- Always review file contents before making further edits to avoid compounding errors.
