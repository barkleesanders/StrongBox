# Repository Cleanup Log

**Date:** 2025-04-28

## Summary
This repository underwent a deep cleanup to ensure compliance with GitHub's repository and file size limits. All files over 100MB were permanently removed from the entire git history using `git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M`. The repository was then aggressively garbage collected. The resulting `.git` directory is now only 48MB (down from 11GB), and no tracked file exceeds 100MB.

## Actions Taken
- Identified and removed all files over 100MB from the entire git history.
- Used `git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M --force` for automated removal.
- Expired reflogs and ran `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` for maximum size reduction.
- Verified `.git` directory shrank from 11GB to 48MB.
- Ensured working tree and HEAD are clean and code is intact.

## Files Removed
- All files over 100MB, including (but not limited to):
    - `.tmp.driveupload/41440` (1.8GB)
    - Any other large binaries, archives, or transient files

## Tools Used
- `git filter-repo`
- `git gc`
- `find`, `du` for size verification

## Impact
- All large, non-essential files are now gone from every commit in the repository.
- The repository is fully compliant with GitHub's 100MB per-file and 5GB total size limits.
- Code, documentation, and essential assets are preserved.

## Next Steps
- Push this cleaned repository to GitHub.
- If any large files are needed for future work, use Git LFS or external storage.
