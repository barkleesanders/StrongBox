# Strong Box
## Greenhouse to the grey Moon!
Only human life has ventured to explore the Moon. Let’s bring new beauty and life to the moon in a 2.00 x 2.00 x 2.00 ft (60.9 x 60.9 x 60.9 cm) Strong Box™ by Out of the Box Astronautics LLC. Constructed from 6.00 x 6.00 x 0.250 inch (15.24 x 15.24 x 0.640 cm ) [304L](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/15n1qk6/the_steel_used_for_starship) Hollow Structural (Stainless) Steel (HSsS) and filled with [Central American Air Plants](https://airplantshop.com/products/5-tillandsia-of-central-america/), [Antarctica McMurdo Dry Valley lichen](https://explorersweb.com/lichen-survives-space/#:~:text=Lichen%20from%20Antarctica%27s%20McMurdo%20Dry,conditions%2C”%20many%20still%20survived.), four [2.5 lbs carbon dioxide (CO2) bottles](https://www.thehomebrewstorefl.com/products/co2-gas-2-5lb), two [NVIDIA® Jetson AGX ORIN](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/), six [2 km LIDAR](https://www.iadiy.com/2km-laser-rangefinder-module), and eight [5 MP Sony IMX568 cameras](https://www.e-consystems.com/nvidia-cameras/jetson-agx-orin-cameras/5mp-imx568-global-shutter-mipi-camera.asp) inside [Ultem 1010](https://www.3dxtech.com/product/thermax-pei-using-ultem-1010) 3D printed enclosures.

## The Strong Box mission has three main objectives:
1) Embark on a pioneering journey to bring the vibrancy of terrestrial plant life to the Moon’s stark, grey landscape. Our mission is to sustain life in an extraterrestrial environment for at least one week, capturing and sharing stunning images of thriving greenery against the Moon’s mystical backdrop with all the Earth. This endeavor is not just about proving survival, but also about inspiring awe and wonder.
2) Lay the foundation for a lunar base by scaling our Strong Box from a compact 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 ft to an expansive 12 x 12 x 12 ft. Utilize the formidable capabilities of SpaceX Starship to accomplish this monumental task, signaling a new era of lunar colonization.
3) Demonstrate the feasibility of a semi-hard lunar landing at approximately 100.0 mph (160.9 km/h = 44.69 m/s), using only camera technology. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize lunar exploration, offering a cost-effective, efficient, and thrilling new pathway to uncover the secrets of the Moon. <br> <br>

## Testing Plan
1) Lift Strong Box to ~700 feet using large drone for a 100 mph terminal velocity drop test
2) 12 x 12 x 12 foot modular from Moe Build to place JSC-1A lunar regolith in with black sky and 5 kW spotlight (sun) to test computer vision code <br> <br>
