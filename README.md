A Green house on the Moon <br>

Only human life has ventured to explore the Moon. Lets bring new beauty and life to the moon via a 2 x 2 x 2 ft (60.96 x 60.96 x 60.96 cm) Strong Box filled with South American Air Plants, Lichen from Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys, CO2, and cameras! <br>
 
The Strong Box mission has three main objectives: <br>
1) Embark on a pioneering journey to bring the vibrancy of terrestrial plant life to the Moon’s stark, grey landscape. Our mission is to sustain life in an extraterrestrial environment for at least one week, capturing and sharing stunning images of thriving greenery against the Moon’s mystical backdrop with the world. This endeavor is not just about proving survival, but also about inspiring awe and wonder.
2) Lay the foundation for a lunar base by scaling our Strong Box from a compact 6 x 6 x 3 feet to an expansive 12 x 12 x 12 feet. Utilize the formidable capabilities of SpaceX Starship to accomplish this monumental task, signaling a new era of lunar colonization.
3) Demonstrate the feasibility of a semi-hard lunar landing at approximately 100 mph (63 km/h), using only camera technology. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize lunar exploration, offering a cost-effective, efficient, and thrilling new pathway to uncover the secrets of the Moon.
