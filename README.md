# Strong Box
## Greenhouse to the grey Moon!
Only human life has ventured to explore the Moon. Let’s bring new beauty and life to the moon in a 2.00 x 2.00 x 2.00 ft (60.9 x 60.9 x 60.9 cm) Strong Box™ by Out of the Box Astronautics LLC. Constructed from 6.00 x 6.00 x 0.250 inch (15.24 x 15.24 x 0.640 cm ) [304L](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/15n1qk6/the_steel_used_for_starship) Hollow Structural (Stainless) Steel (HSsS) and filled with [Central American Air Plants](https://airplantshop.com/products/5-tillandsia-of-central-america/), [Antarctica McMurdo Dry Valley lichen](https://explorersweb.com/lichen-survives-space/#:~:text=Lichen%20from%20Antarctica%27s%20McMurdo%20Dry,conditions%2C”%20many%20still%20survived.), four [2.5 lbs carbon dioxide (CO2) bottles](https://www.thehomebrewstorefl.com/products/co2-gas-2-5lb), two [NVIDIA® Jetson AGX ORIN](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/), six [2 km LIDAR](https://www.iadiy.com/2km-laser-rangefinder-module), and eight [5 MP Sony IMX568 cameras](https://www.e-consystems.com/nvidia-cameras/jetson-agx-orin-cameras/5mp-imx568-global-shutter-mipi-camera.asp) inside [Ultem 1010](https://www.3dxtech.com/product/thermax-pei-using-ultem-1010) 3D printed enclosures, and a single [Class O or Class S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_rocket_motor_classification) solid rocket engine. <br> <br>

## The Strong Box mission has three main objectives:
1) Embark on a pioneering journey to bring the vibrancy of terrestrial plant life to the Moon’s stark, grey landscape. Our mission is to sustain life in an extraterrestrial environment for at least 13.65 Earth days, capturing and sharing stunning images of thriving greenery against the Moon’s mystical backdrop with all the people of Earth. This endeavor is not just about proving survival, but also about inspiring awe and wonder.
2) Lay the foundation for a lunar base by scaling our Strong Box from a compact 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 ft to an expansive 12 x 12 x 12 ft with workng HVAC / enviromental control. This 12 foot module would utilize the formidable capabilities of the SpaceX Starship, signaling a new era of lunar exploration.
3) Demonstrate the feasibility of a semi-hard lunar landing at approximately 100.0 mph (160.9 km/h = 44.69 m/s), using only camera technology. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize lunar exploration, offering a cost-effective, efficient, and thrilling new pathway to uncover the secrets of the Moon. <br> <br>

## 2024 Test Plan:
1) Lift Strong Box to ~333 feet (on Earth) using a 15K USD crane or rented large drone to simulate a 100 mph terminal velocity impact on the Moon (See math [HERE](https://github.com/OpenSourceIronman/StrongBox/blob/main/KinematicEquations.py))
2) 12 x 12 x 12 foot vacuum chamber pod (from Moe Build LLC) with JSC-1A lunar regolith, vanta black painted sky, and [11.69 kW Halogen spotlight](https://www.desisti.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ds_SuperLeo_10_12kw.pdf) (sun sim) to test computer vision code
3) Test fire suicide burn with small [Sugar &  Potassium  Nitrite (KNO3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fR9neVnS8) solid rocket engine with impluse of 159 N*s <br> <br>

## 2025 Test Plan:
1) Hang Strong Box inside a 12 x 12 x 12 foot vacuum chamber pod to test [CO2 based four nozzle cold gas thruster](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2111&context=smallsat) 
2) Test fire Class O solid rocket engine with [Tripoli Vegas Rocketry](https://www.tripolivegas.com/) <br> <br>
